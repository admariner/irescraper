,Finding immigration stories in data about communities and people,2018-06-14,2:30 p.m.,2018-06-14,3:30 p.m.,False,"Tim Henderson, Paul Overberg - Covering immigration is more than raids and rallies and restaurants. As the share of immigrant Americans nears record levels, it's finding stories about how immigrants change once here, and how they change the people and places around them. It's also knowing how to knock down myths and fears with facts. Learn how reporters use Census and other demographic data to cover immigration and how it's changing your community.

,Master class: Mastering the interview (Print focus) **pre-registered attendees only,2018-06-14,2:30 p.m.,2018-06-14,6:00 p.m.,False,"Ken Armstrong - When it comes to interviewing, some reporters are naturals. ProPublica's Ken Armstrong isn't one of them. He'll share the (many) mistakes he's made and what he's learned from them. This workshop will move from getting the interview, to conducting the interview, to capitalizing on the interview when it's time to write.
â¨Topics will include:â¨-
*How — and when — to land a tough interviewâ¨-
*The power of silenceâ¨-
*The power of sincerityâ¨-
*Interviewing people who have been hurt, and interviewing the people who hurt themâ¨-
*How to interview someone who won't talk to you (and yes, this can be done — sort of)
We will venture, ever so briefly, into the mysterious realm of emotions (open mind, open heart). We'll challenge some of the conventional wisdom surrounding interviewing (pure hooey, some of it). And we'll watch outstanding interviewers at work, studying what they do — and, more important, what they don't do.

Social media sharing of content related to mass shootings, the people who commit them, their names, images, and “manifestos” also seems to increase the likelihood of subsequent mass shootings. Meanwhile, the news media have a responsibility to bear witness to events of public interest and attempt to make sense of the seemingly senseless, hold institutions (including their own) accountable for failures, and examine the psychological and social factors that might help predict and prevent mass shootings. How can the news media do their job while minimizing the potential harms of their coverage? What guidance does the research provide?

,Finding the story: Immigration,2018-06-16,10:15 a.m.,2018-06-16,11:15 a.m.,False,"Angilee Shah - There are some 320 million people in the U.S., and 43 million of them were born abroad. About 11 million people are undocumented and over 5.1 million children have at least one undocumented parent. 860,000 people have applied for temporary legal status because they were brought to the U.S. without proper documentation as children. Over 500,000 people are waiting for their cases to be heard in immigration courts. Some 270,000 people in the U.S. came as refugees. On any given day, about 40,000 people are in immigration detention.
The numbers surrounding immigration can be daunting and hard to track down. At this popular session from IRE and CAR, participants walk away with a new data set and ideas for stories to dig into locally. And we'll work together to question numbers about immigration — and talk about what to do when the government is not providing data about its immigration actions.
This session is good for: Anyone. No technical skills are needed for this workshop, though a little bit of comfort with math and some perseverance will help.
