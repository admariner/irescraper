,Techraking 21: Bootstrapping the news (Sponsored by Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting),2018-03-07,1:00 p.m.,2018-03-07,5:00 p.m.,"Michael Corey, Eric Sagara, Emmanuel Martinez","Register for this event here.
Give us four hours and your laptop, and we'll send you into NICAR with a fully-functioning data-crunching machine and the knowledge to use it.
One of the biggest hurdles to learning programming is the often bewildering process of setting up your computer. Veteran programmers and data crunchers from Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting will give you a virtual playground on your personal laptop that will allow you to explore all the tools you'll gather throughout the conference. In this four-hour workshop, we'll introduce crucial programming concepts and tools and -- most importantly -- why we use them.
You'll walk into conference sessions with a laptop loaded with many of the tools presenters will be talking about, and a leg up as you continue developing your skills once you're back home.

About 11 million people are undocumented and over 5.1 million children have at least one undocumented parent. 860,000 people have applied for temporary legal status because they were brought to the U.S. without proper documentation as children. Over 500,000 people are waiting for their cases to be heard in immigration courts. Some 270,000 people in the U.S. came as refugees. On any given day, about 40,000 people are in immigration detention.
The numbers surrounding immigration can be daunting and hard to track down. In this session, we'll go through some of the most useful datasets available and talk about some of the data that's a bit tougher to find. We'll talk about how to use that data to get leads on local and national stories — and what to do when the government is not providing data about its immigration actions.

And at colleges, TV money has tripled athletics revenue, which has warped spending at a lot of schools, enriching coaches and marketing agencies alike.

Data journalism is disappearing from the web. 
Data journalism is more fragile than most people realize. Every time a news organization reorganizes its staff or updates its CMS or stops paying the bill for the data team's servers, complex data journalism projects are lost. Conventional archiving methods, like the Internet Archive's crawlers or the automated archiving feeds of companies like Lexis-Nexis, are no longer sufficient to capture projects that involve big data, databases, streaming data or interactive graphics.
In this session, we'll discuss why data journalism is the new digital ephemera, and we'll explore the state of the art for archiving. We'll talk about strategies data journalists can use to preserve their own work and how news organizations can better preserve their valuable digital assets. Finally, we'll report on how journalists, librarians and scholars are thinking about future-proofing the news.
