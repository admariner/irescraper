The digital divide (Sponsored by The Media Consortium),2016-06-16,9:00 a.m.,2016-06-16,10:00 a.m.,False,"Christopher Mitchell, Matthew Rantanen, Michael Scurato - Fifteen percent of Americans don't use the internet—and they aren't all seniors. In rural areas, on reservations and in prisons, many users simply don't have access. The story of lack of access deepens when we overlay “access” with economic data. For example, 62% of Spanish-dominant Latinos do not have broadband access at home. A significant number of users can't afford to have access when or how they want it.
We'll explore questions like, do users really have internet access if the only access is mobile wireless or, if the cost is 10% of their monthly wage? Will the proposed lifeline program impact a significant number of people? Speakers will also explain the implications of lifeline access, the hope community broadband offers, and provide tools/sources so you can investigate internet access across geographic, demographic and policy lines.

Tools have been built to find check-worthy claims, track false claims in the news and social media, automatically annotate false claims and pair them with fact checks published elsewhere.

Maybe that's the problem – even as pros we make basic mistakes in interviews because we are not thinking strategically and tactically. Politicians, businesspeople and PR flacks are experts at jumping on the smallest opening we give them, the tiniest mistake in formulating a question. It's not just about getting the facts out – it's about how to dramatically rethink the way you approach interviews, how to master the basic rules of tough interviews, and then learn how to break them when needed.

Sources who help expose corruption or misconduct sometimes violate the law by taking evidence that is not their property. But what about the source who is breaking the law in real-time or who tells a journalist about the crimes that she plans to commit? What can a journalist do to protect a source who is keeping classified information on a home computer? Information which the journalist will shortly publish a story about that will focus law enforcement attention directly on the source? What if the crime goes beyond just spiriting documents out of the office and involves more serious offenses – and the journalist know about it? Other real-life episodes to be considered include: Dealing with sources who proffer classified information, sources who secretly (but unlawfully) record telephone calls or intercept other communications, the risks involved when a source is also a computer hacker, and little-known tools that can be used to protect anonymous sources. This session will focus on how the law treats these cases and what can be done by journalists to protect themselves and their sources from criminal exposure - and still get the story.

Being able to model and query data as a graph enables us to draw insights from highly connected data such as email records, leaked documents, and public data.
In this hands on session we will introduce you to the Neo4j graph database, including:
- An overview of the property graph data model and how to model data as a graph
- A comparison of the property graph to other data models and database systems
- How to load datasets into Neo4j from public web APIs
- How to query Neo4j using Cypher, the query language for graphs
- How to use graph visualization tools to explore and draw insight from the data
This hands-on session is intended for those familiar with basic database concepts and who have at least some experience working with a database (such as writing SQL queries).
