,Mapping Camp *pre-registered attendees only,2016-06-16,9:00 a.m.,2016-06-16,6:00 p.m.,"David Herzog, Jennifer LaFleur","Learn how to uncover interesting news stories by mapping data with geographic information system (GIS) software during our intensive mini-boot camp and receive a free copy of ArcGIS Desktop*.
IRE and NICAR trainers conduct this hands-on training using the latest version of ArcGIS Desktop. We will look at noteworthy stories that have used mapping and show you how to uncover stories using census and other data. You'll learn how to display data geographically; import and query data; geocode to merge databases with addresses into maps. Attendees will also learn how ArcGIS Online may help as a storytelling platform. In addition, we'll provide you with our boot camp materials to help keep you on track long after you leave the conference. 
Participants should have some experience working with data in a relational database manager, such as Microsoft Access or MySQL. Preregistration is required and seating is limited. Laptops will be provided for the training. Please note the desktop software is available only for Windows but ArcGIS Online can be used from any platform.
*Attendees of the boot camp have the option to receive the following discounts from Esri. (1) A free license of ArcGIS Desktop that will not expire and includes one year call-in technical support and upgrades at no cost. Call-in technical support and upgrades are available on a nominal fee basis in year two. (2) A free one-year subscription to ArcGIS Online that includes access to Esri's Community Analyst database. Please contact the Esri Media Relations team press@esri.com for further information. The desktop software is available only for Windows but ArcGIS Online can be used from any platform.

The digital divide (Sponsored by The Media Consortium),2016-06-16,9:00 a.m.,2016-06-16,10:00 a.m.,"Christopher Mitchell, Matthew Rantanen, Michael Scurato","Fifteen percent of Americans don't use the internet—and they aren't all seniors. In rural areas, on reservations and in prisons, many users simply don't have access. The story of lack of access deepens when we overlay “access” with economic data. For example, 62% of Spanish-dominant Latinos do not have broadband access at home. A significant number of users can't afford to have access when or how they want it.
We'll explore questions like, do users really have internet access if the only access is mobile wireless or, if the cost is 10% of their monthly wage? Will the proposed lifeline program impact a significant number of people? Speakers will also explain the implications of lifeline access, the hope community broadband offers, and provide tools/sources so you can investigate internet access across geographic, demographic and policy lines.

Tools have been built to find check-worthy claims, track false claims in the news and social media, automatically annotate false claims and pair them with fact checks published elsewhere. How far are we from a ""holy grail"" of entirely automated fact-checking? What can we do in the meantime? And how can developments in this field help investigative reporters in their work?

You'll come away with plenty of story ideas and also learn about publicly available databases that you can download and analyze to produce great local stories.
In this workshop, led by experienced IRE and NICAR trainers, we'll explore how to use Excel, a fairly simple but powerful spreadsheet application, to begin analyzing data for stories. We'll start from the beginning with basic formulas and work our way up to summarizing information using PivotTables and more. How do you think about data analysis as a journalist? How do you find the story within the columns and rows? Depending on the experience level of the group we may discuss advanced functions in Excel including data cleaning and more. 
We'll walk through a number of searchable databases currently available online and show you how you can download information into a spreadsheet so you can start analyzing data as soon as you leave the workshop.
No previous experience is required for this workshop. Preregistration is required and seating is limited. Computers will be provided for the training. **Attendees must be registered for the conference to attend this workshop.

Sources who help expose corruption or misconduct sometimes violate the law by taking evidence that is not their property. But what about the source who is breaking the law in real-time or who tells a journalist about the crimes that she plans to commit? What can a journalist do to protect a source who is keeping classified information on a home computer? Information which the journalist will shortly publish a story about that will focus law enforcement attention directly on the source? What if the crime goes beyond just spiriting documents out of the office and involves more serious offenses – and the journalist know about it? Other real-life episodes to be considered include: Dealing with sources who proffer classified information, sources who secretly (but unlawfully) record telephone calls or intercept other communications, the risks involved when a source is also a computer hacker, and little-known tools that can be used to protect anonymous sources. This session will focus on how the law treats these cases and what can be done by journalists to protect themselves and their sources from criminal exposure - and still get the story.

Being able to model and query data as a graph enables us to draw insights from highly connected data such as email records, leaked documents, and public data.
In this hands on session we will introduce you to the Neo4j graph database, including:
- An overview of the property graph data model and how to model data as a graph
- A comparison of the property graph to other data models and database systems
- How to load datasets into Neo4j from public web APIs
- How to query Neo4j using Cypher, the query language for graphs
- How to use graph visualization tools to explore and draw insight from the data
This hands-on session is intended for those familiar with basic database concepts and who have at least some experience working with a database (such as writing SQL queries).
