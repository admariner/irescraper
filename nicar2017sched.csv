Give us four hours and your laptop, and we'll send you into NICAR with a fully-functioning data-crunching machine and the knowledge to use it.
One of the biggest hurdles to learning programming is the often bewildering process of setting up your computer. Veteran programmers and data crunchers from Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting will give you a virtual playground on your personal laptop that will allow you to explore all the tools you'll gather throughout the conference. In this four-hour workshop, we'll introduce crucial programming concepts and tools and -- most importantly -- why we use them.
You'll walk into conference sessions with a laptop loaded with many of the tools presenters will be talking about, and a leg up as you continue developing your skills once you're back home.
Additional details including the schedule for the workshop can be found on the conference website.

Evan Wyloge, senior reporter at AZCIR (the Arizona Center for Investigative Reporting) has spent a decade focusing on accountability and watchdog reporting, with an emphasis on data analysis. In this workshop, he will identify disparate datasets that allow reporters to analyze the evolving economic landscape of metro areas.
Population density, incomes and property values, the overall volume of economic activity, and racial and ethnic diversity are all clues that can help reporters understand the dynamic shift toward a more urbanized population. Wyloge will show you how to navigate surprising databases and mine the key points to develop insightful stories on the future of your community.
This pre-conference workshop is produced by the Donald W. Reynolds National Center for Business Journalism.

Your code is hard to understand. Bugs are cropping up. Worse, you can't always explain your process or results to an editor — or yourself. There must be a better way, but the path forward is not clear. If you've had that itchy feeling, this full-day, hands-on workshop is for you. After mastering the basics of writing code, you need to understand how to design programs. To that end, this class will explore Python language features that will help you write readable, reliable and reusable code.
