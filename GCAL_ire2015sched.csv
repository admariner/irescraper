Others are landlords who ignore occupancy rates to crowd as many rent-paying students into a single property as possible, creating fire traps. Some simply ignore the most basic safety measures like installing working smoke detectors.

Before Daniel Ellsberg, Edward Snowden, Chelsea Manning and Wikileaks, there was the Citizens Commission to Investigate the FBI.
In March 1971, eight citizens broke into an FBI office in Media, Pennsylvania, took hundreds of secret files and shared them with the public. The files revealed massive political surveillance by the FBI against activists in the civil rights movement, the antiwar movement and every movement for rights, including the women's and gay rights movements.
Despite an intense five-year search for the burglars, the group was never found. Most of them revealed their identities for the first time in Betty Medsger's 2014 book, The Burglary: The Discovery of J. Edgar Hoover's Secret FBI and in filmmaker Johanna Hamilton's documentary film, 1971.
Three of the burglars will participate in a panel discussion with Medsger, a former Washington Post reporter who was one of the five recipients of the FBI files initially distributed by the Media burglars, and Hamilton.

It will cover the VR landscape for journalism and the adjacent fields, including just enough history to set the scene and use the advances of our predecessors. And then it's onto sharing our experience so far: lessons about working in this massively new medium. It seems to require journalists to re-learn huge swathes of their craft, but almost everyone is in the same boat. This presentation will get specific: talking about narrative tools, production equipment. Attendees should come away with enough of a solid knowledge base from which to start putting together a VR production process.

This session will dive into several environmental topics that you can investigative no matter where you live. We'll dig into:
-Fish Consumption Rates: Many states estimate the average fish consumption rate for its residents as a means of setting an allowable water pollution standard. What's your state's fish consumption estimate? What does it say about how much pollution your regulators are allowing? How does it compare to your neighboring state? Why the difference?-Dam Safety: They're almost everywhere yet there's a level of secrecy imposed on the National Inventory of Dams. We'll offer databases and tips for local reporters to examine safety records and other relevant issues. http://tinyurl.com/SEJdams-Manure: It ain't what it used to be. Modern factory farms have made this a pervasive issue nationwide that gets little coverage. Very powerful interests exert influence on state and municipal officeholders when it comes to regulating (or scaling back regulation) of manure, runoff, containment, etc. Yet new lawsuits and scientific findings are now pushing back (“Your ruling will change everything” a dairy exec recently told a federal judge). Drinking water, shellfish beds, fishing, swimming beaches, and much more is affected. We'll provide contacts, sources, databases, lawsuit transcripts, etc.-Pipeline Safety: There is a pipeline safety story in almost every community, and one key to those stories is skill at using available map data. This data is imperfect, but no longer AS secret as it once was. PHMSA may have new regulations that could be unveiled in time for IRE.

So where does illegal immigration fall on the spectrum of crimes, and how should you explain it in your stories? For legal immigration: Is the new arrival skilled or unskilled; adult or minor? Is an employer willing to sponsor him or her? Are they eligible for asylum because of persecution in their homelands?
