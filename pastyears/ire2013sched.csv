Reynolds National Center for Business Journalism will offer a free workshop from 2-5 p.m. on June 19: Breaking Local Stories with Economic Data.

Especially this year, with the release of the every-five-year Economic Census, journalists will have a unique opportunity to track changes in their local community from 2007 - before the recession - to 2012. Instructors Paul Overberg of USA TODAY and Jeannine Aversa, late of The AP, now with the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, will provide you with a road map to finding and delivering at least 15 local enterprise stories from government economic data. Examples will be specific to the San Antonio region, but applicable anywhere. Sign up here for this free workshop.  Registration begins at 1:30 p.m. for this workshop.

Drugs come in standard names and common units, patient ages are given in years, the data represents the entire market. You can perform a few simple calculations in a spreadsheet or some straightforward queries in a database manager, and you're ready to hit the streets for reporting. With ever-more data at hand, though, many databases are messy or incomplete, often because they rely on entries by users. Working with such data can be hellish. But the right tools and approaches can save hours of time and frustration and help ensure accurate findings. Index tables, standardizing queries, customized coding scripts, year-to-year analysis, and other techniques and approaches can help uncover the gems buried in muddy data. In this session we'll discuss all of this and you'll see some of these suggestions put into practice for analyzing Medicare claims data used in ""Cracking the Codes"" the 2012 Philip Meyer Award winner.
