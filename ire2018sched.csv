Attendees are encouraged to participate in both sessions. Pre-registration is not required, but seats are limited in this workshop.
Libel and invasion of privacy (9 - 10:30 a.m.)
This workshop will focus on the legal problems which can arise from your content: How can you avoid getting sued for defamation and invasion of privacy? We'll discuss what the plaintiff has to prove to make out a libel case, your common law and constitutional defenses, the differences in defending cases brought by public and private figures, privileges for opinion and using public records, and the effect of corrections, denials, libelous implications and using anonymous sources. Lawsuits for publishing truthful but embarrassing private facts will also be considered. Discussion leaders: George Freeman, Media Law Resource Center; and Carol LoCicero, Thomas & LoCicero
Copyright and digital media (11 a.m. - 12:30 p.m.)
This workshop will cover hot issues in copyright and the law of digital media. We will start with a consideration of copyright law; just because something is on the internet does not mean it's free for the taking. What is copyrightable, the fair use of newsworthy information and embedding and aggregation of content will all be discussed. We will also talk about ways in which the law treats online speech differently from traditional media, including the ramifications of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act and the role of social media platforms. Discussion leader: Jeff Hermes, Media Law Resource Center; and Rachel Fugate, Shullman Fugate""

*How — and when — to land a tough interviewâ¨-
*The power of silenceâ¨-
*The power of sincerityâ¨-
*Interviewing people who have been hurt, and interviewing the people who hurt themâ¨-
*How to interview someone who won't talk to you (and yes, this can be done — sort of)

According to a recent study of more than 2,700 newsroom managers and journalists from 130 countries, at least half of those surveyed don't use any tools or methods to protect their data and information online. Given the importance of journalism to open societies everywhere, it's important to ensure that newsrooms and journalists are equipped with the tools and training they need to be successful — and safe — while doing their work. 
Attend this workshop to learn how to protect yourself and your news organization from hacking, phishing, malware, other digital attacks and censorship — for the upcoming election season and beyond. More info: https://goo.gl/h7wTX1

We do interviews every day, often without thinking. Maybe that's the problem – we make basic mistakes in interviews because we are not thinking strategically and tactically. Journalists too often think all we need is a lot of research and a few pointed queries. But the politicians, businesspeople and PR flacks are experts at jumping on the smallest opening we give them, the tiniest mistake in formulating a question. 
It's not just about getting the facts out – it's about how to dramatically rethink the way you approach interviews, how to master the basic rules of tough interviews and then learn how to break them when needed. 
We'll cover:
* The three universal types of interviews (and why you need to know what you are after)
* The five basic rules of good interviews
* How to break those rules
* What to do when you get into trouble (and you always will)
* Strategy and planning: When to trip the wire, what to do when they refuse an interview, how best to prepare
This course aims to radically change the way you prepare and approach your interviews, with plenty of examples of interviews from media around the world that worked well and some that failed miserably.

,Finding the story: Immigration,2018-06-16,10:15 a.m.,2018-06-16,11:15 a.m.,Angilee Shah,"There are some 320 million people in the U.S., and 43 million of them were born abroad. About 11 million people are undocumented and over 5.1 million children have at least one undocumented parent. 860,000 people have applied for temporary legal status because they were brought to the U.S. without proper documentation as children. Over 500,000 people are waiting for their cases to be heard in immigration courts. Some 270,000 people in the U.S. came as refugees. On any given day, about 40,000 people are in immigration detention.
The numbers surrounding immigration can be daunting and hard to track down. At this popular session from IRE and CAR, participants walk away with a new data set and ideas for stories to dig into locally. And we'll work together to question numbers about immigration — and talk about what to do when the government is not providing data about its immigration actions.
