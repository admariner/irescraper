The War on Terror has provided the raison d'etre for the massive build up of the surveillance state and the rise of other increasingly restrictive government and corporate measures that are now tripping alarm bells about threats to our civil liberties. Many of those bells were set off by whistleblowers who could no longer ignore their conscience, along with the journalists who were willing to listen to them. Hence we are seeing the most aggressive and destructive campaign waged against whistleblowers and journalists in presidential history. This campaign has destroyed lives, ruined families, exacted immeasurable psychological and physical costs, and ultimately resulted in the demonization of those willing to step forward. Journalists, in particular, face urgent questions about how to protect their sources and themselves, as well as whether they shouldn't more aggressively challenge this ""other war.""Join four prominent speakers in a provocative discussion about the new, more dangerous threats to whistleblowers, why going through ""official channels"" hasn't worked, what journalists should and shouldn't do when working with whistleblowers, what countermeasures are being developed to protect whistleblowers and ensure that vital stories involving government and corporate secrecy and corruption see the light of day.

 From Aurora to Sandy Hook to Fort Hood (again), a spate of mass shootings has gripped our attention and fueled a fierce national debate about guns. But there's been a critical problem: Good data on these types of events—and on gun violence more broadly—has been hard to come by, in part due to the suppression of federal research. In the last two years, journalists have worked to fill this void, scouring news reports and combing through limited federal, state, and local government records on guns and gun violence. Several news organizations have built their own data projects documenting mass shootings and gun deaths, and produced quality narrative reporting using them. Yet without an agreed-upon methodology for compiling and analyzing such complex, incomplete data sets, the findings of these investigations have varied. This panel will bring together journalists behind these investigations, and others who have reported on gun violence in notable ways, for a conversation about how to cover this crucial subject matter. Can a set of best practices be determined for gathering gun data, or is there value in having disparate approaches? What data is most important to include? Why has it been so hard to access such information in the past, and what key research has yet to be done? All of this and more will be on the table.

These processes make your work more efficient, and your product more accurate. Then, we discuss specific techniques to manage the momentum and impact of the narrative.

What can be done to strengthen the Freedom of Information Act?
We have a chance to set the agenda of the newly formed FOIA Modernization Advisory Committee. The group, which met for the first time this week, includes one of our own: IRE member Andrew Becker. We are working together to solicit and collect as much input on the administration of FOIA as possible. The goal: To boost the influence journalists have on the committee, chiefly composed of government employees.
The committee is the most significant conduit for change to open records laws since the FOIA was enacted in 1966. It's mission is to “improve the administration of the law.” The agency that oversees this group, the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS), works to help requesters like you solve FOIA-related issues. A representative of OGIS is aware of our efforts and will be at the conference with her notebook ready.
Are fees your biggest roadblock to information? Blanket redactions? Response time? Something else? Let's decide together.
Join us this Saturday, June 28 at 4:50 pm to be a part of the discussion. Don't let reform happen without you. Steering the committee's direction isn't all we're doing.
This is also a chance for you to join the growing #FOIAFriday community. More than a hashtag, #FOIAFriday is a space to share tips, ask for advice and coordinate efforts to improve access to public information.
From New York's Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) to California's Public Records Act (CPRA) and everything in between, we've got you covered.
Leading the discussion Saturday will be journalists Ellen Gabler and Djordje Padejski, and attorney Duffy Carolan. Gabler's award-winning story for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on deadly delays in newborn screening programs drew heavily from data obtained via records requests filed around the country. Padejski founded FOIA Machine, an online platform that automates FOIA requests and helps journalists keep track of documents. Carolan is a lawyer with extensive experience representing journalists seeking information via state and federal open records laws. All will share tips from their experience obtaining, litigating and fighting for public records.
