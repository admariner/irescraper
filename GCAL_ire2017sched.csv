Reynolds National Center for Business Journalism, will be held on Wednesday, June 21 from 2-5 p.m.

From ZIP code-level business patterns and foreign trade imports to property tax rolls and professional licenses, Doig will walk you through seldom-used databases that hold treasures for reporters.

You'll leave armed with new knowledge and fresh ideas. Doig's original “10 Data Sources” presentation at IRE 2016 drew a capacity crowd.

Pretrial release is a national issue, with critics contending that the longstanding cash bail system keeps many non-violent suspects behind bars just because they can't pay small sums to be freed pending trial. Bail bondsmen insist that they are the best people to ensure that defendants who are released return for court appearances. This session features the chief justice of Arizona, who has led a reform effort, the president of a national organization that deals with the issue, and a reporter who covers it.

Reporters at The Boston Globe, The Chronicle of Higher Education and NerdWallet's investigative team are probing aspects of the system, and have experiences and tips to share. UMass Boston's mission is to serve students from poor and immigrant families, but for decades the university has suffered from poor leadership and physical neglect. The Globe is examining why vulnerable students, and taxpayers, are left to foot the bill. Across the country other students are lured by for-profit colleges that overload them with debt. Scammers identify likely victims and target them in student-loan ""debt relief"" scams of the type exposed by The Chronicle and NerdWallet, which  recently completed investigative stories and launched an SEO-juiced web tool to warn consumers. In another project, The Chronicle's Title IX Tracker monitors sexual-assault investigations. Probing the Ivory Tower may seem daunting, but it's increasingly important in a world where education can still be a way to narrow the gap between rich and poor.

Some will refuse to talk, demand you only interview them instead of decision-makers or drag their feet in hopes you'll go away. Well, we've got strategies to help you battle back against those who become a “Public Interference Officer”. This panel will offer useful tips and tricks you can use to make sure you can plow past any PIO.

Journalists today are confronted by an unprecedented series of challenges in pursuing the truth.

Now, we are contending with a president and an administration that are openly antagonistic towards the media, and a large portion of the public that does not believe what we report. When administration officials talk about “alternative facts” and assail the already-damaged credibility of news organizations, how should reporters go about our jobs? In the face of all these challenges, how do we champion the truth?

,Optimizing a news organization for trust: Lessons from De Correspondent's success in The Netherlands,2017-06-25,9:00 a.m.,2017-06-25,10:00 a.m.,False,"Jay Rosen - Founded in 2013, the Dutch startup De Correspondent is the most successful member-funded news site in the world. It now has 56,000 members paying 60 Euros a year because they believe in the mission, a budget of $3.5 million, 21 full-time correspondents, 75 paid freelancers, and a supporting cast of 25 editors, developers and business people.
No ads. No sponsors. No fat cat donors. No foundations that can cut off funding. No tracking. No clickbait. No targeting. No captivity to the daily news cycle. The model grants broad latitude to the writers to define their own beats and decide their own reporting projects. In exchange they are required to bring readers into the reporting process and treat members as a knowledge community. It works: They have an 80 percent renewal rate, which is very high for a membership community. Now they are planning to expand to the U.S.
Jay Rosen of NYU is working with De Correspondent on its expansion plans. He will explain how their ""writer = knowledge community"" model works and answer questions about member-funded journalism. He will also explain how De Correspondent optimizes everything it does to generate user trust. Bring your experiences with crowd-sourcing and reader engagement in the reporting process, and we can compare notes.
