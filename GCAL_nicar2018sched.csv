Give us four hours and your laptop, and we'll send you into NICAR with a fully-functioning data-crunching machine and the knowledge to use it.
One of the biggest hurdles to learning programming is the often bewildering process of setting up your computer. Veteran programmers and data crunchers from Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting will give you a virtual playground on your personal laptop that will allow you to explore all the tools you'll gather throughout the conference. In this four-hour workshop, we'll introduce crucial programming concepts and tools and -- most importantly -- why we use them.
You'll walk into conference sessions with a laptop loaded with many of the tools presenters will be talking about, and a leg up as you continue developing your skills once you're back home.
