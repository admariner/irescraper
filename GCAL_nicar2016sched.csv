Register now!
Give us four hours and your laptop, and we'll send you into NICAR with a fully-functioning data-crunching machine and the knowledge to use it.
One of the biggest hurdles to learning programming is the often bewildering process of setting up your computer. Veteran data crunchers and programmers from Reveal/The Center for Investigative Reporting will give you a virtual playground on your personal laptop that will allow you to explore all the tools you'll gather throughout the conference. In this four-hour workshop, we'll introduce crucial programming concepts and tools and -- most importantly -- why we use them.
You'll walk into conference sessions with a laptop loaded with many of the tools presenters will be talking about, and a leg up as you continue developing your skills once you're back home.
Additional details including the schedule for the workshop can be found on the conference website.

What do readers need to understand about our techniques to properly interpret the results of our analysis? Should we publish source/raw data? These are a few of the questions we will raise and attempt to answer — with your help. Audience participation will be an important part of this session.

We hear a lot of the following during discussions about creating mobile-friendly data-driven experiences: “It's not possible to make good interactives on mobile.” “It'll hurt our work on desktop.” “It's not worth the effort.” “It's too hard.” One thing is true: Making a news app work well on mobile requires different methodology than is commonly utilized today – but that doesn't necessarily mean a worse process or an inferior product. In fact, mobile-friendly interactives better serve news audiences, and creating these experiences is possible (and practical!) to do. This session will teach attendees how to better present and share data-driven content on the mobile web. We'll cover the best practices for developing mobile-friendly, accessible data visualizations, which will help news application designers and developers create interactive graphics that work universally and are accessible via assistive technologies like screen readers.

It's the great newsroom double bind: keep up with new technologies or risk becoming obsolete,. but do it while keeping up your day job (which takes all your time). If everyone in the newsroom feels this pressure, the news apps developers and CAR reporters who thrive on being the cool kids on the bleeding edge can feel it even more keenly. In this session, we'll consider some of the methods we use as individuals and as teams to overcome this challenge and build an environment that fosters continuous learning. A few questions we'll consider: How do I continuously hone my chops and keep current with changing technology if that's not the only thing I do with my time? What strategies have individuals and teams developed that build learning into their workflows and routines? How can editors help create a team culture that supports learning and experimentation without sacrificing productivity? And how can these lessons be applied more broadly to help less technically minded reporters catch up and keep up?

Usually the first step is using a relational (or SQL) database. While a relational database can be a good choice for some datasets, data analysts today turn to new tools to gain deeper insight. This talk will show how we can use a graph database to analyze highly connected data using examples from U.S. Congressional data and political email archives. Using the U.S. Congress data, we'll show you how to explore the dataset using Cypher, the Neo4j query language, to discover legislator activity including bill sponsorship and voting activity. Building up our knowledge of Cypher as we progress, we'll show how you can use principles from social network analysis to find influential legislators and discover what topics legislators have influence over. Finally, we will examine how to draw insights from the Hillary Clinton email dataset, released as part of a FOIA request earlier this year. We will explore this dataset as a graph of interactions among users, answering questions like: Who is communicating with Hillary the most? What are the topics of these emails? You'll learn how to visualize these using the Neo4j browser to quickly make sense of the data as we are exploring.
The goal of this talk is to provide a demonstration of database tools that any journalist can use to explore datasets and draw insights from connected datasets.

How do you transition from a journalist who does data stuff sometimes to a full-fledged coder in your newsroom and what happens when you do? This session will help you take your data skills to the next level by giving you easy-to-replicate projects and newsroom tools that involve minimal coding and can be done in most locations and beats. Panelists will take you through some “easy wins” for your newsroom and discuss their experiences navigating newsrooms as the only coder in the room, as well as how to get buy-in from your boss and to convince higher-ups of the extra value in these types of projects.

How would you and your newsroom fair in digging out little known facts and information under the pressure of a breaking news deadline? One of the best ways to get better is to practice. In this exercise, we want you to imagine that you're a journalist in Denver when breaking news hits your scanner. Get a game plan and figure out where you want to search. Try to find as much information that can help you move the story forward with a watchdog eye. Set the clock as a timer for 5- to 10-minute intervals to see how quickly you can find information. Once you're done, compare yourself to others in the room. This is a real life scenario where you can learn to break news by never leaving your computer. The skills learned in this seminar can also be used for turning daily general assignment stories when there's NOT breaking news. This session regularly fills up and the tipsheet that comes with it is in high demand. If you're interested get there early to get a seat.
