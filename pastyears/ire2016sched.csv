For example, 62% of Spanish-dominant Latinos do not have broadband access at home. A significant number of users can't afford to have access when or how they want it.
We'll explore questions like, do users really have internet access if the only access is mobile wireless or, if the cost is 10% of their monthly wage? Will the proposed lifeline program impact a significant number of people?

Investigative journalism at the turn of the 20th Century relied, for the most part, on a breed of driven newspaper and magazine reporters working solo, and keeping their sources to themselves. Much changed starting in the 1960s, with the rise of team journalism (including the birth of IRE) at places like Bob Greene's Newsday and the Boston Globe's Spotlight operation. Duos along the lines of Woodward-Bernstein and Barlett-Steele sprang up, and so did investigative editing specialists and, recently, intra-organizational collaborations. Reporting and editing legends Jim Steele and James Grimaldi join the Center for Investigative Reporting's Jennifer LaFleur in a discussion of what's been gained, and lost, along the way.

Reporters will get together to share strategies for pursuing watchdog and investigative stories while working for editors whose management styles can make the work more difficult.

Stories about troubled children -- from babies born with drug addictions to youths abused and neglected in licensed childcare facilities or at home under the watch of social workers -- often are hidden under a veil of secrecy and shielded by convoluted confidentiality laws. Reporters from the NY Daily News, Reuters and the New England Center for Investigative Reporting provide useful tips on how to access hard-to-find information using state and federal public disclosure laws as well as report and write impact-driven stories with the help of often vulnerable sources and innovative storytelling techniques. These investigations can have direct and tangible impacts on laws and policies.

Sources who help expose corruption or misconduct sometimes violate the law by taking evidence that is not their property. But what about the source who is breaking the law in real-time or who tells a journalist about the crimes that she plans to commit? What can a journalist do to protect a source who is keeping classified information on a home computer - and the journalist will shortly publish a story that will focus law enforcement attention directly on the source? What if the crime goes beyond just spiriting documents out of the office and involves more serious offenses – and the journalist know about it? Other real-life episodes to be considered include: Dealing with sources who proffer classified information, sources who secretly (but unlawfully) record telephone calls or intercept other communications, the risks involved when a source is also a computer hacker, and little-known tools that can be used to protect anonymous sources. This session will focus on how the law treats these cases and what can be done by journalists to protect themselves and their sources from criminal exposure - and still get the story.

What goes on inside conservative religious communities? How do we access parallel societies? Why do young boys turn into Isis fighters? And how can we help each other cover these stories and share information?
TV 2 Denmark invites you to an informal meet and greet session. We hope to meet and exchange contact information with other reporters from around the globe who share the interest in covering these subjects. We think that forming an international network of journalists could be useful and hopefully we will be able to help each other in the future. TV 2 Denmark has worked extensively with closed religious communities -- over the past months the station has aired four documentaries based on hidden-camera recordings by two moles installed in a conservative religious community in Denmark. A short excerpt from the series will be played.

Like the campuses themselves, colleges' police departments, whether public or private, exist in a world of secrecy. Ohio and Texas are but a few states that have forced private universities to open records to the public. Even so, it's becoming increasingly difficult to pry loose records about sexual assaults and other serious crimes on campus. Police are slow to alert students about serious crimes – and often ignore those that happen off campus, where the majority of students live. And they're even more reluctant to release information about excessive use of force by campus police. But there are ways to work around these roadblocks. Come to this session to learn how.

It's a pretty simple language that does something pretty powerful: it lets you communicate with your database and spell out exactly the questions you want to ask about your data. Using the lightweight SQLite database manager, we'll focus on queries that can be used in many different database programs. Join us for a gentle introduction to SQL that will convince you this stuff isn't so hard. This is the first in a series of two classes.
Suggested Technical Experience: Familiarity with spreadsheets will be useful, but no previous database experience or other technical knowledge required.

Surveillance has gone 360 degrees. Live video footage scrambled by jammers. Stingrays intercept phone calls. Video from drones flying overhead can immediately be parsed by facial recognition software to identify individuals. Metadata helps the NSA (and corporations) guess where we will go next, who we associate with, and more. Increasingly, the NSA, FBI and local police work together to conduct surveillance on activists--and journalists.
