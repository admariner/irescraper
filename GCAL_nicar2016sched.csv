You'll learn what's in the data sets, how to get them, what you can pull from them, what questions to ask of the data and story ideas that could be developed, and you'll leave armed with new knowledge and fresh ideas.

Register now!
Give us four hours and your laptop, and we'll send you into NICAR with a fully-functioning data-crunching machine and the knowledge to use it.
One of the biggest hurdles to learning programming is the often bewildering process of setting up your computer. Veteran data crunchers and programmers from Reveal/The Center for Investigative Reporting will give you a virtual playground on your personal laptop that will allow you to explore all the tools you'll gather throughout the conference. In this four-hour workshop, we'll introduce crucial programming concepts and tools and -- most importantly -- why we use them.
You'll walk into conference sessions with a laptop loaded with many of the tools presenters will be talking about, and a leg up as you continue developing your skills once you're back home.
Additional details including the schedule for the workshop can be found on the conference website.

You will get hands-on experience in every stage of the development process, writing Python, HTML and JavaScript using version control tools. You won't stop until you've deployed a working application onto the World Wide Web. 
Preregistration is required and seating is limited. Laptops will be provided for the training.
Session prerequisites: If you have a good attitude and know how to take a few code crashes in stride, you are qualified for this class.
Attendees must be registered for the conference to attend this workshop.

Your code is hard to understand. Bugs are cropping up. Worse, you can't always explain your process or results to an editor — or yourself. There must be a better way, but the path forward is not clear. If you've had that itchy feeling, this half-day, hands-on workshop is for you.
After mastering the basics of writing code, you need to understand how to design programs. To that end, this class will explore Python language features that will help you write readable, reliable and reusable code.
Preregistration is required and seating is limited. Laptops will be provided for the training.
Session prerequisites: Experience with basic Python language features like variables, data types, conditionals and functions are required.
